# --- OpenRouter API Configuration ---
openrouter:
  api_key: "YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY_HERE"
  # Model to use for generating implementation guides (via OpenRouter)
  # Example: "google/gemini-1.5-pro-latest", "openai/gpt-4o", "anthropic/claude-3-opus"
  # The user's request specified "google/gemini-2.5-pro". Ensure this model identifier is correct on OpenRouter.
  gemini_model: "google/gemini-2.5-pro" # Verify this model string on OpenRouter

  # Optional headers for OpenRouter API calls (helps your app appear on leaderboards)
  site_url: "<YOUR_SITE_URL_OR_PROJECT_URL>" # e.g., https://yourproject.com
  site_name: "<YOUR_APP_OR_PROJECT_NAME>"    # e.g., MyProject FeatureGen

# --- File Path Configurations (relative to the project root) ---
# These paths are interpreted relative to the directory where auto_feature.sh is run (i.e., your project root).
paths:
  project_context: "project_context.md"
  repo_contents: "repo_contents.txt"
  features_file: "features_to_implement.txt"
